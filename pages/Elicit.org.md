- Elicit seems specialized on the analysis of biomedical papers and clinical trials: its preconfigured queries (bottom-left column) pertain *interventions*, *outcomes measured*, and *number of participants*.
- The capture shows a [[synthesis query]].
- We also tried [[whole-document summarization]]. A first pdf failed to upload, in a second attempt we got a good one-sentence summary but none of the pre-specified queries were relevant.
