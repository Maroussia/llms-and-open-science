- Elicit seems specialized on the analysis of biomedical papers and clinical trials: its preconfigured queries (bottom-left column) pertain *interventions*, *outcomes measured*, and *number of participants*.
- It offers  [[synthesis query]] and [[whole-document summarization]]. A first pdf failed to upload, in a second attempt we got a serviceable one-sentence summary but none of the pre-specified queries were relevant to the document's topic.
