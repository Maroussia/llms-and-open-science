- Prompt: Can you provide references about Franson interferometry, preferably ones that discuss how to entangle massive particles?
- Answer:
	- Certainly! Here is a list of references related to Franson interferometry and some that discuss entangling massive particles. Keep in mind that the knowledge cutoff for this AI is September 2021, so there might be more recent publications available.
	- Franson, J. D. (1989). Bell inequality for position and time. Physical Review Letters, 62(19), 2205-2208. [This is the original paper by J. D. Franson, where he proposes the Franson interferometer.]

	- Aspelmeyer, M., Kippenberg, T. J., & Marquardt, F. (2014). Cavity optomechanics. Reviews of Modern Physics, 86(4), 1391-1452. [This review article discusses cavity optomechanics, which can be used to entangle massive particles by coupling them to the state of a light field.]
	- Marshall, W., Simon, C., Penrose, R., & Bouwmeester, D. (2003). Towards quantum superpositions of a mirror. Physical Review Letters, 91(13), 130401. [This paper discusses the possibility of creating quantum superpositions and entanglement of massive objects, such as a mirror, using optomechanical systems.]

Nature, 464(7289), 697-703. [This paper reports an experiment in which the authors successfully demonstrated quantum control of a mechanical resonator, which is a step toward entangling massive particles.]
	  
	  These references provide an introduction to Franson interferometry and some approaches to entangling massive particles. I encourage you to explore further literature and more recent publications to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
