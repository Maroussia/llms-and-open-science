- [[use case]]: ask a question whose answer will be composed from a multitude of sources, potentially involving encyclopedias, textbooks and refereed sources.
- [[Scite.ai]] links to actually existing papers, in typical footnote format.
- [[GPT4]] needs to explicitly be asked for citations. GPT4 may need prompt tuning, but then references are correct and very relevant.
- [[Scite.ai]] had differing quality levels for different domains:
	- Very good in neuroscience (question about sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus)
	- Incomplete in quantum physics, slight incoherence (question about Franson interferometry)
	- Wrong on machine learning, major incoherence (question about likelihood-free inference)
- GPT4 produced answers that were more comprehensive and prompt-related than scite.ai
