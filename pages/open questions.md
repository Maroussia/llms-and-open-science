- # Copyright and LLMs
- What will be the status of attribution and copyright/copyleft?
- Reminder: copyright is tied to the particular expression of an idea
- Does an LLM, by synthesizing and paraphrasing, launder copyrighted information into useable text or code that needs not acknowledge sources?
- Conversely, do LLMs allow to overcome the absurd stranglehold, for even longer periods of protection, of copyright holders on the accumulated human culture?
- For science, what is the realm of "common knowledge"?
  Common knowledge can go unattributed but research knowledge needs attribution if the meritocratic system currently in place is to continue.
- # The rise of personalized content
- Today, creating new materials (books, articles, blog posts) seems like the hot new thing to do with LLMs. But if you could instantly access personalized content based on a query (replacement for the search string of yonder) *plus* some or even a large quantity of context reflecting your previous knowledge, would you reach for the textbook or the web search for pre-existing materials?
- # Inclusivity 
  * Leveling the playing field for non-native speakers?
  * Helping conceptual thinkers vs. implementors. For example
     * humanities researchers can now more easily translate ideas into code
     * busy PIs do not need as much PhD help to code up ideas 
     * menial HiWi work is handled by (often more competent) AIs
