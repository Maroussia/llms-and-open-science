- # Copyright in the age of LLMs
- What will be the status of attribution and copyright/copyleft?
- Reminder: copyright is tied to the particular expression of an idea
- Does an LLM, by synthesizing and paraphrasing, launder copyrighted information into useable text or code that needs not acknowledge sources?
- Conversely, do LLMs allow to overcome the absurd stranglehold, for even longer periods of protection, of copyright holders on the accumulated human culture?
- For science, what is the realm of "common knowledge"?
  Common knowledge can go unattributed but research knowledge needs attribution if the meritocratic system currently in place is to continue.
## What will be the future of pregenerated content vs. personalized content produced in real time?
- Today, creating new materials seems like the hot new thing to do with LLMs. But
## Inclusivity
* Leveling the playing field for non-native speakers?
* Helping conceptual thinkers vs. implementors
* for example: humanities researchers can now more easily translate ideas into code
* busy PIs do not need as much PhD help to code up ideas
* menial HiWi work is handled by (often more competent) AIs
