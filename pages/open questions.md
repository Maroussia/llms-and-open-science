- # Copyright in the age of LLMs
- What will be the status of attribution and copyright/copyleft?

### What is the realm of "common knowledge"?

## What will be the future of pregenerated content vs. personalized content produced in real time?
## Inclusivity
* Leveling the playing field for non-native speakers?
* Helping conceptual thinkers vs. implementors
* for example: humanities researchers can now more easily translate ideas into code
* busy PIs do not need as much PhD help to code up ideas
* menial HiWi work is handled by (often more competent) AIs
