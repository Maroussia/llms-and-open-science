- This list does not include Bard (only US-accessible) and Bing (requires MS Edge, proprietary software). We included only services that offer a free trial (but we used a paid ChatGPT subscription for access to GPT4)
  
  Products used for summarization:
- [[kagi Universal Summarizer (US)]]
- [Elicit]()
- https://www.semanticscholar.org
- [Scite]
- : summary was kind of ok but lacked some nuance; output was fast.
- Elicit: seems very geared towards clinical trials (sections bar). First pdf upload failed. Second attempt: good one-sentence summary, but none of the pre-specified queries were relevant. Seems like a stiff system.
- Scite.ai (16â‚¬/month)
- GPT4 - lacks direct input from documents (plugins / separate API services such as chatpdf provide the ingestion)
- connected papers (don't know how AI driven that is yet)
