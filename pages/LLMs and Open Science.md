- A survey of the role of [[Large Language Models]] in [[Open Science]].

- # Summary
	- [[Science]] is a collective endeavor that involves actors such as [[researchers]], [[students]], [[communicators]], [[administrators]] and the [[general public]] in various roles. In this post, we analyse a schematic science workflow, from conceptualization to dissemination through [[literature review]], actual research and [peer-reviewed](peer review) [[publication]]. We identify [[opportunities]], and [[pitfalls]], for the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) throughout the pipeline, and review contentious aspects of LLM use in the particular context of the OpenScience movement.
	- LLMs already provide substantial help across a range of use cases, including literature review (knowledge exploration, source discovery, citation matching, relevance assessment, summarization and synthesis), assessment (peer review, essay rating, CV scoring, citation valence rating), research design (brainstorming, experimental design, criticism), code (explanation, documentation, optimization, generation, translation and adaptation), data analysis and visualization (by writing bespoke code), writing of exercise sheets, grants, presentations, articles or dissemination pieces (outline expansion, grammatical and stylistic support, translation).
	- Some unique characteristics of LLMs as research companions are their comprehensive databank of facts, a conversational character with multiple rounds of refinement, or an output that is sensitive to previous interactions and elicited by targeted prompts.
