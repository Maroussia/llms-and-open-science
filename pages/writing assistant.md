  As a non-English native speaker scholar, I am about to publish a paper in my field. The paper is drafted. I have got a couple of hours before the deadline and decide to use an LLM model to translate the draft into formal English, editing the final LLM output and making sure the scientific outcomes are accurately expressed.

  I have been asked by editors to produce an abstract by tonight for the paper I just submitted.I quickly write a summary of the paper in bullet points and use an LLM to translate these bullet points into a paragraph of the required length.

  I am applying to different colleges and I wrote a general application text. I use an LLM to transform my text and make it specific to different universities/programs.

#### Advantages
Improved essay/paper language quality
Save time
Allows scholars to focus on their work/speciality
#### Testimony

> "I feel that I myself have benefitted enormously from getting to conduct my entire professional life in my own native language, and I believe that I would be less successful if I had to do this in another language. AI writing assistants can level the playing field here, by automatically mapping English inputs to Standard Literary English. I cannot in good conscience stand in the way of this. If I had to create all my course materials in another language, I would be enormously grateful to have access to technology like this." Christopher Potts, Stanford Professor of Linguistics, [Against University-wide policies concerning AI writing assistants](https://chrisgpotts.medium.com/against-university-wide-policies-concerning-ai-writing-assistants-2cea347108dd)(Feb. 19, 2023).
#### _Possible Disadvantages:_
People are even less forgiving when someone writes in unconventional English. Everything will be even more in English than before.
Students can use LLM to avoid learning writing skills.
