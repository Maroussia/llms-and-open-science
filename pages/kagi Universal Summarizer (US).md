- Kagi.com is a for-pay, non advertising-based search engine. The Universal Summarizer service of kagi needs an account but then allows light usage for trial. It is fast and does not have the length limits of GPT when pasting content in. It works on URLs provided by the user and delivers both a text summary and a selection of key points as bullet points on further request.
