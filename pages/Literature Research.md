- ## Activities
  Literature research is a set of activities consisting of **finding** prior work across a multitude of sources (refereed papers, textbooks, monographs, blog posts, tweets, datasets), **ranking** the work by relevance and establishing it's credibility, **extracting** data, statements, figures and interpretations from those sources, **digesting** the information into source-bound summaries (e.g. paper summary) or topic-bound summaries (a review), all while keeping track of attribution information such that further communication reliably accounts for the sources used and enables the audience to examine individual claims in their original context at the source.
- ## User Roles

  * [[students]] when preparing essays as part of coursework
