- This list does not include Bard (only US-accessible) and Bing (requires MS Edge, proprietary software). We included only services that offer a free trial (but we used a paid ChatGPT subscription for access to GPT4)
  
  Products used for summarization:
- [[Kagi's universal summarizer (US)]]
- [[Elicit.org]]
- https://www.semanticscholar.org
- [Scite]
- : summary was kind of ok but lacked some nuance; output was fast.
- Scite.ai (16â‚¬/month)
- GPT4 - lacks direct input from documents (plugins / separate API services such as chatpdf provide the ingestion)
- Products we did not evaluate of which we did not know what
- connected papers (don't know how AI driven that is yet)
