- ## Activities
  Literature research is a set of activities consisting of **finding** prior work across a multitude of sources (refereed papers, textbooks, monographs, blog posts, tweets, datasets), **ranking** the work by relevance and establishing it's credibility, **extracting** data, statements, figures and interpretations from those sources, **digesting** the information into source-bound summaries (e.g. paper summary) or topic-bound summaries (a review), all while keeping track of attribution information such that further communication reliably accounts for the sources used and enables the audience to examine individual claims in their original context at the source.
- ## User Roles 
  
  Typical roles that engage in literature research activities include
  
  * [[students]] when preparing essays as part of coursework
  * [[researchers]] when performing gap analysis to decide on new research, or looking for background information
  * members of the [public](general public) seeking to understand the current state of research in areas of their interest, e.g.
    *  health conditions, gender-specific job applicant behaviour, environmental life-cycle assessment of consumer products, impact of public-health interventions on the spreading of transmissible disease, etc.
  * [[communicators]] when offering context for new research findings, e.g.   
    * e.g. explaining a new breakthrough in quantum communication by first providing background on entangled photon pairs
- ## Exemplary user stories
  
  * **Paper summarization**: as a researcher, I want to obtain a summary of a paper that highlights major results. 
  * **Conceptual synthesis**: as a researcher, as a citizen, as a student, I want to obtain a consolidated definition of a scholarly concept that combines encyclopedia and research knowledge and that substantiates statements via citations of peer-reviewed literature
  * **Contextualization and impact assessment**: as a researcher, I want to see citations to a paper in context. Were those citations supportive, neutral or contrasting, i.e. challenging the original claims.
